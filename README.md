Go trics and warts
==================

This repo is about some architectural problems which you can encounter while developing Go projects. <br />
It presents solutions for some patterns and warts.

The structure of each pattern is: ``<pattern_name><type>``
Where:
  * ``<pattern_name>.go`` is a pattern you want to solve
  * ``<pattern_name>_s<digit>*.go``  good solution for the pattern
  * ``<pattern_name>_wrong<digit>*`` wrong solution, which have some warts.

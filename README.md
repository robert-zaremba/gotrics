Go trics and warts
==================

This repo is about some architectural problem which you can encounter while developing Go projects. 

It presents solutions for some patterns and warts you can fall into

The structure of each pattern is: ``<pattern_name><type>``
Where:
  ``<pattern_name>[ | s<digit>* | wrong<digit>*]`` is a pattern you want to solve
  ``s<digit>*``  good solution for pattern
  ``wrong<digit>*`` wrong solution, which have some warts.

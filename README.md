Go trics and warts
==================

This repo is about some architectural problems which you can encounter while developing Go projects. <br />
It presents solutions for some patterns and warts.

The structure of each pattern is: ``<pattern_name><type>``
Where:
  * ``<pattern_name>[ | s<digit>* | wrong<digit>*]`` is a pattern you want to solve
  * ``s<digit>*``  good solution for pattern
  * ``wrong<digit>*`` wrong solution, which have some warts.
